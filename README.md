Our work was published and accepted at **The 19th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG 2025)**.  
Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15564](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15564)

This project implements **CauSkelNet**, a causal representation learning framework for analyzing human behavior using joint-level motion data. It integrates the **Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm** and **Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence** to infer causal relationships between body joints, with applications in pain recognition and movement analysis.

## üìÅ Directory Overview

### `Output/`  
Contains evaluation figures (`.png`) that visualize model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, recall) across different movement tasks:
- `bend_metrics.png`
- `onelegstand_metrics.png`
- etc.

### `Software/`  

#### `Model_Train/`  
Core training and evaluation scripts.
- `Evaluation/`: Includes baseline and causal GCN model notebooks for individual movement types such as:
  - `baseline_Bend.ipynb`
  - `baseline_onelegstand.ipynb`
  - `baseline_sittostand.ipynb`
- Other notebooks such as `Guard Graph.ipynb`, `Non-Guard Graph.ipynb` focus on generating and analyzing causal graphs for protective vs. non-protective behaviors.

## üöÄ Usage

To analyze human behavior using causal graphs and train the causal GCN model:

1. **Step 1: Generate Causal Graphs**
   - Run the following notebooks to compute and visualize causal relationships between joints:
     - `Detail.ipynb`, `Detail_non.ipynb`
     - `Guard Graph.ipynb`, `Guard Graph 3.ipynb`, `Guard Graph Detail Bend and StS and Stsit.ipynb`
     - `Non-Guard Graph.ipynb`, `Non-Guard Graph 3.ipynb`, `Non Guard Graph Detail Bend and StS and Stsit.ipynb`
   - These notebooks construct causal Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) for protective and non-protective behaviors across movement types.

2. **Step 2: Train and Evaluate Models**
   - Navigate to `Software/Model_Train/Evaluation/`
   - Run baseline and causal GCN model notebooks, such as:
     - `baseline_Bend.ipynb`
     - `baseline_onelegstand.ipynb`
     - `baseline_sittostand.ipynb`
     - `General.ipynb` (core implementation)
   - These notebooks compare model performance with and without causal structure.
